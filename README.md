## Description
This is a C# console application that will request the user to input a random number (this number will be the length of the Array)
and then that number of random numbers. Example: "random number: 4. Now it will ask you for 4 random numbers."
The program will then prompt you to give it some more numbers and it will do math (add all the numbers you gave it, multiply by a number of your choosing,
and then divide it by yet, another number).
